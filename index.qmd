[Add to Calendar](calendar/uocms_fall2025.ics)

## Upcoming Lectures

**Speaker:** [Alejandro Adem](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~adem/), University of British Columbia  
**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Title:** Topology and Symmetries  
**Abstract:** In this lecture we will discuss how methods from algebraic topology can be applied to shed light on fundamental
 questions related to finite group actions. We will start with basic invariants such as the Euler characteristic and explore
  classical applications such as topological space forms as well as more recent work about actions on 4-dimensional manifolds
   (joint with I. Hambleton). This will be illustrated with a variety of examples, as well as some open problems.

**Speaker:** [Florian Dumpert](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ry3IviAAAAAJ&hl=de), Federal Statistical Office of Germany  
**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Location:** Exceptionally, this colloquium will take place in STEM 464.  
**Title:** Reflections Regarding the Procedure and Methodology of Statistical Data Editing  
**Abstract:** Statistical data editing in statistical production is, on the one hand, an essential part of the quality assurance
of incoming data (and thus, subsequently, of the products of official statistics). On the other hand, however, it is also a
comparatively complex and time-consuming step. Naturally, attempts are therefore regularly made to increase the efficiency of
editing. (Which is also - by the way - entirely in keeping with the concept of quality.) German official statistics are currently
undergoing a paradigm shift. Whereas in the past, data was often first accepted and then checked for plausibility, in future
only (more or less) clean data is to be accepted. Selective editing and automated processing of the majority of cases, including
the use of Machine Learning, are then the next step – a procedure that is nothing new in the world of official statistics. 
The presentation will nevertheless address these points and take a closer look at some of them. In particular, a procedure for
automated editing will be presented in more detail and the question of when a replacement of incorrect values can be described
as 'good' or 'successful' will be examined.

## Past Lectures

**Speaker:** [Giusy Mazzone](https://mast.queensu.ca/~gmazzone/index.html), Queen's University  
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Title:** [On the Mathematical Analysis of Fluid–Solid Interaction Problems](https://mast.queensu.ca/~gmazzone/publications.html)  
**Abstract:** I will present several models describing the interactions between
viscous incompressible fluids and solids, which may be either rigid or
deformable. The governing equations for these interactions consist of the
Navier–Stokes equations coupled with either the Euler equations for rigid body
dynamics or the Navier equations of linearized elasticity. A common feature of
these problems is that the governing equations have a dissipative—conservative
(parabolic—hyperbolic) structure: while the fluid introduces dissipation in the
mechanical energy of the coupled system, the solid contributes to the same
energy with a conservative (more generally, non-decreasing) component. From a
mathematical perspective, this interplay poses significant challenges when
establishing the existence and stability of solutions to the governing
equations. I will provide an overview of my contributions to the analysis of
these problems for various mechanical systems involving fluid–solid
interactions.

**Speaker:** [Jen Hom](https://jhom6.math.gatech.edu/), Georgia Institute of Technology  
**Title:** 3-Manifolds, Groups, and Heegaard Floer Homology  
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Location:** Exceptionally, this colloquium will take place in STEM 464.  
**Abstract:** We will consider various ways to build 3-manifolds. Under the operation of connected sum, 
the set of 3-manifolds forms a monoid, and modulo an appropriate equivalence relation, this monoid becomes
 a group. What is the structure of this group? What families of three-manifolds generate (or don’t generate) 
 this group? We give some answers to these questions using Heegaard Floer homology. This is joint work with
  (various subsets of) I. Dai, K. Hendricks, M. Stoffregen, L. Truong, and I. Zemke.

**Speaker:** [Sumiya Baasandorj](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QyoI7fQAAAAJ&hl=en), University of Ottawa  
**Title:** Regularity for a Class of (Non)Variational Problems with (Non)Standard Growth  
**Date:** September 25, 2025  
**Abstract:** Regularity issues in (non)variational problems with (non)standard growth have been
a central topic of analysis, witnessing tremendous development over the past century.
Regularity techniques ultimately aim to show that suitable weak or distributional solutions
are, in fact, classical solutions. In this talk, I will present some recent regularity
results for a class of variational functionals with nonstandard growth conditions,
namely the so-called Orlicz double phase functional. This will involve revisiting the
fundamental contributions of De Giorgi and Nash and connecting them with recent advances
in nonuniformly elliptic problems. Furthermore, I will try to give an overview of
the regularity theory for nonvariational elliptic problems, such as the Monge–Amp`ere
equation, and discuss its connections to optimal transport theory.

**Speaker:** [Emanuele Naldi](https://sites.google.com/view/emanuelenaldi/home-page), University of Genoa  
**Title:** [Inexact Jordan–Kinderlehrer–Otto and Proximal-Gradient Algorithms in the Wasserstein Space: Links and Differences from the Hilbert Case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23517)  
**Date:** September 18, 2025  
**Abstract:** In this talk, we explore the asymptotic convergence properties
of inexact Jordan–Kinderlehrer–Otto (JKO) scheme and proximal-gradient
algorithm in the Wasserstein space. While the classical JKO scheme
assumes exact minimization at each step, practical implementations rely
on approximate solutions due to computational constraints. We analyze
two types of inexactness: errors in Wasserstein distance and errors in
functional evaluations. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees
under controlled error conditions. Beyond the inexact setting, we also
extend the convergence results by considering varying stepsizes. Our
analysis expands previous approaches, providing new insights into
discrete Wasserstein gradient flows. We finish the talk with a comparison to the Hilbert space setting, where
the proximity operator is nonexpansive, a property that plays a central
role in many classical convergence results. In the Wasserstein setting,
the nonexpansivity of the proximity operator generally fails, even for
geodesically convex functionals. We discuss the class of functions for
which this property still holds and highlight potential directions for
future research.

**Speaker:** [Susanne Pumplün](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mathematics/people/susanne.pumpluen), University of Nottingham  
**Title:** [On Skew Constacyclic Codes and their Surprising Connection to Nonassociative Algebra](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.06695v1)  
**Date:** September 11, 2025  
**Abstract:** Cyclic, constacyclic and skew constacyclic codes are some of the most important and 
most investigated classes of linear codes (some are now also being used to build quantum 
error-correcting codes). Their cyclic structure allows us to characterize them using polynomials 
or skew polynomials, and to describe them as ideals in an algebra. More precisely, each codeword 
corresponds to a (skew) polynomial in a suitable chosen ideal of its ambient algebra. This ambient algebra may, 
however, be not associative. This is not well known, as all approaches 
so far only worked with associative ambient algebras or divert to ambient submodules. In the first part of the 
talk we will thus set up a cohesive theory that includes the nonassociative case. In the second part, we will address the problem how to classify skew constacyclic codes using the isomorphisms of their ambient algebras. We propose a new definition of equivalence that will result in tighter code classifications than previously presented ones, and will help to de-duplicate codes with the same performance paramenters. We prove with combinatorial methods that the notions of isometry and equivalence defined by Ou-azzou et al. (2025) coincide when the ambient algebras are not associative.

**Title:** [Representation Equivalent Neural Operators: A Framework for Alias-Free Operator Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19913)  
**Date:** September 4, 2025  
**Abstract:** Recently, operator learning, or learning mappings between infinite-dimensional 
function spaces, has garnered significant attention, notably in relation to learning partial 
differential equations from data. Conceptually clear when outlined on paper, neural operators 
require discretization in the transition to computer implementations. This step can compromise 
their integrity, often causing them to deviate from the underlying operators. This research 
offers a fresh take on neural operators with a Representation equivalent Neural Operators (ReNO) 
framework designed to address these issues. At its core is the concept of operator aliasing, 
which measures inconsistency between neural operators and their discrete representations. More 
generally, this framework not only sheds light on existing challenges but, given its 
constructive and broad nature, also potentially offers tools for developing new neural 
operators. This is a joint work with Rima Alaifari, Emmanuel de Bézenac, Siddhartha Mishra, 
Roberto Molinaro and Bogdan Raonić.
