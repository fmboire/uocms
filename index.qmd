**Room:** STEM 664  
**Title:** Uncovering All Highly Credible Binary Treatment Hierarchy Questions in Network Meta-Analysis  
**Abstract:** Decision problems with multiple treatment options generate a vast number of possible “hierarchy” questions, such as which treatments are consistently
 among the best, or whether certain options consistently rank in a particular order. As the number of treatments grows, this space becomes too large to evaluate
  systematically. In network meta-analysis (NMA), a workaround is to pre-specify hierarchy questions of interest and evaluate their empirical support, but this 
  risks overlooking other strongly supported conclusions. We propose an efficient algorithmic approach that automatically identifies all binary hierarchy questions 
  whose empirical support exceeds a chosen credibility threshold (e.g., 95%), followed by a pruning step that removes redundant results. We classify binary hierarchy 
  questions into six types, spanning conventional comparisons based on pairwise comparisons or ranking probabilities as well as more complex structures. The method is 
  implemented in an R package and illustrated using NMAs on diabetes and depression treatments.

**Speaker:** [Christiane  Rousseau](https://dms.umontreal.ca/~rousseac/), Université de Montréal  
**Date:** February 11, 2026  
**Title:** The Equivalence Problem in Analytic Dynamics  
**Abstract:** A central problem in local dynamics is the equivalence problem: when are two analytic systems locally equivalent under an analytic change
 of coordinates? In the neighbourhood of a singular point, representatives of equivalence classes could be given by normal forms. But, most often, the 
 changes of coordinates to normal form diverge. Why? What does it mean? 
Unfolding the singularities reveals the geometric obstructions to the convergence to normal form. In this talk, we discuss a class of singularities and 
their unfoldings for which we can provide moduli spaces for the equivalence problems. We explain the common geometric features of these singularities, 
and how the study of the unfolding of these singularities allows understanding both the singularities themselves, and the obstructions to the existence
 of analytic changes of coordinates to normal form.

### Fall 2025 - Special Lectures in Analysis and Numerical Methods

---

**Speaker:** [David Jekel](https://davidjekel.com/), University of Copenhagen  
**Date:** Wednesday, December 17, 2025, 3:00-4:00 pm  
**Room:** STEM 664  
**Title:** Contractibility of the Unitary Group of von Neumann Algebras  
**Abstract:** This talk addresses the topological properties of infinite-dimensional objects coming from functional analysis. 
Kuiper in the 1960s proved that the group of unitary operators on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space is a contractible 
space, meaning it can be continuously deformed to a point. We consider the analogous question of contractibility of the unitary 
groups of von Neumann algebras, which are certain algebras of operators on a Hilbert space. The last unsolved case was that of 
"finite" von Neumann algebras (those which satisfy that $xy = 1$ implies $yx = 1$ similar to finite-dimensional matrix algebras). 
We solve this case by a fundamentally different technique than the other cases, inspired by random matrix theory. We construct 
a homotopy by first smoothing out the spectral measure of the unitaries using free convolution, then applying functional calculus 
to push the mass toward 1.

**Speaker:** [Conor McCoid](https://conormccoid.com/), McMaster University  
**Date:** Monday, December 15, 2025, 3:00-4:00 pm    
**Room:** STEM 664  
**Title:** Advances in Schwarz Methods  
**Abstract:** Schwarz methods partition numerical domains to take advantage of parallelization in computing, while also 
acting as preconditioners. The domains may be partitioned physically into distinct regions, by field into distinct 
behaviours, and/or algebraically into distinct degrees of freedom. Schwarz methods tend to produce only linear convergence 
rates, and so should be combined with fast solvers such as Newton's method or Krylov subspace methods. In this talk I 
explore two such approaches and new techniques to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. The first approach combines 
Newton and Schwarz in the context of a brittle fracture model, where I've added new backtracking to stabilize the Newton 
iterations. The second is a novel combination of Schwarz with Krylov subspace techniques.

**Speaker:** [Loïc Cappanera](https://www.math.uh.edu/~lcappan/), University of Houston  
**Date:** Friday, December 12, 2025, 3:00-4:00 pm  
**Room:** STEM 664  
**Title:** Numerical Methods for Incompressible Flows with Variable Density: Analysis and Applications  
**Abstract:** Incompressible multiphase flows, meaning flows involving fluids with variable density and viscosity, arise
 in many natural phenomena such as the interactions between the Earth mantle's layers or between the ocean and atmosphere. 
 Such flows also play an important role in engineering applications such as the production of aluminum or the storage of 
 energy using liquid metal batteries. Thus, the development of efficient and robust numerical methods to approximate 
 incompressible multiphase flows is crucial to bring a better understanding of the above problems.
In this context, we will first highlight the main challenges one faces when solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes 
equations that governs the dynamics of such flows. After describing some of the classic methods used to approximate these 
equations when the density is constant, we will introduce two novel discretization for problems where the density is 
variable. We assume that fluids are immiscible and that the dynamical viscosity is a function of the density. Thus, 
the viscosity also becomes a space-time dependent variable. The proposed methods both use a level set technique to 
track the interface between the fluids and to reconstruct the fluid's density and viscosity. Both methods also uses 
the momentum, equal to the density times the velocity, and the pressure as primary unknowns. This particular choice, 
commonly used in compressible fluid mechanics, allows us to derive formulations that yield time-independent stiffness 
matrices and that are suitable for spectral and pseudo-spectral methods. The two proposed methods differ on how the 
incompressibility constraint is enforced. One method uses a pressure correction projection method while the other uses 
an artificial compressibility technique. We will first analyze the stability and convergence properties of both our methods. 
Then, we will investigate numerically their robustness and accuracy on various setups involving either manufactured 
solutions, rotating flows or magneto-convection. We will conclude with a short outlook on future promising research 
directions.

**Speaker:** [Tattwamasi Amrutan](https://tattwamasiamrutam.wordpress.com/), Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences  
**Date:** Wednesday, December 10, 3:00-4:00 pm  
**Room:** STEM 364  
**Title:** A Unified Perspective on Rigidity: From Groups to $C^*$-Algebras  
**Abstract:** We will study the "Rigidity phenomena" which lie at the heart of modern group theory and dynamics. 
Beginning with Margulis's Normal Subgroup Theorem, we will see that fixed-point structures survive surprising enlargements 
of the objects under study—from subgroups to invariant random subgroups, and beyond. In this talk, I will present a unified
 perspective on rigidity by passing through three increasingly flexible categories: deterministic fixed points, 
 probabilistic fixed points, and finally operator-algebraic fixed points inside group $C^*$-algebras and von Neumann algebras.
  I will describe new results establishing non-commutative analogues of "Intermediate Factor Theorems" and a 
  characterization of invariant subalgebras for free groups. Finally, I will also discuss the emergence of strict 
  comparison in the reduced group $C^*$-algebra of $F_2$.  


### Fall 2025

**Speaker:** [Anush Tserunyan](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/atserunyan/), McGill University  
**Date:** December 4, 2025  
**Title:** A Pointwise Approach to Pointwise Ergodic Theorems  
**Abstract:** Pointwise ergodic theorems link the global behaviour of a dynamical system to the local, often combinatorial, statistics observed along individual
 orbits. They are powerful tools in ergodic theory, probability, number theory, and beyond. I will present a general yet elementary method for proving such 
 theorems, inspired by ideas from descriptive set theory. This approach yields new kinds of pointwise ergodic theorems; I will describe several examples arising
  from joint work with Jenna Zomback.

**Speaker:** [Mark Reesor](https://www.wlu.ca/academics/faculties/faculty-of-science/faculty-profiles/mark-reesor/index.html), Wilfrid Laurier University  
**Date:** November 20, 2025  
**Title:** Approximating the Money-Weighted Rate of Return  
**Abstract:** We develop a closed-form approximation to the so-called money-weighted rate of return (MWRR), in the context of a stylized retirement
 savings account. The approximation is general in the sense that (i) it allows for contributions of varying sizes made at irregularly-spaced times
  (including both discrete and continuous contributions), (ii) it allows the composition of the underlying portfolio (as manifested through the mean
   and standard deviation of its instantaneous return) to vary through time and (iii) it does not make any specific assumptions on the stochastic
    dynamics of the underlying portfolio return. The approximation facilitates insights into a complicated object, which in turn allows us to explain
     and/or resolve findings elsewhere in the literature. This is joint work with A. Metzler, M. Lau and D. Polegato.

**Speaker:** [Bruno Feunou Kamkui](https://sites.google.com/view/bruno-feunou/home), Bank of Canada  
**Date:** November 13, 2025  
**Title:** [Generalized Autoregressive Positive-Valued Processes](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07350015.2023.2239869)  
**Abstract:** We introduce generalized autoregressive positive-valued (GARP) 
processes, a class of autoregressive and moving-average processes that extends 
the class of existing autoregressive positive-valued (ARP) processes in one important dimension: each conditional moment dynamic is driven by
a different and identifiable moving average of the variable of interest. The article provides ergodicity conditions for GARP processes
and derives closed-form conditional and unconditional moments. The article also presents estimation and
inference methods, illustrated by an application to European option pricing where the daily realized variance
follows a GARP dynamic. Our results show that using GARP processes reduces pricing errors by substantially
more than using ARP processes.

**Date:** November 6, 2025  
**Title:** The Kardar–Parisi–Zhang Fixed Point  
**Abstract:** We will survey some of the mathematics that has come out of the study of one dimensional random growth models, in 
particular the surprising connection to integrable partial differential equations.  The talk is intended for a very broad audience
 and no background is assumed.

**Speaker:** [Florian Dumpert](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ry3IviAAAAAJ&hl=de), Federal Statistical Office of Germany  
**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Location:** Exceptionally, this colloquium will take place in STEM 464.  
**Title:** Reflections Regarding the Procedure and Methodology of Statistical Data Editing  
**Abstract:** Statistical data editing in statistical production is, on the one hand, an essential part of the quality assurance
of incoming data (and thus, subsequently, of the products of official statistics). On the other hand, however, it is also a
comparatively complex and time-consuming step. Naturally, attempts are therefore regularly made to increase the efficiency of
editing. (Which is also - by the way - entirely in keeping with the concept of quality.) German official statistics are currently
undergoing a paradigm shift. Whereas in the past, data was often first accepted and then checked for plausibility, in future
only (more or less) clean data is to be accepted. Selective editing and automated processing of the majority of cases, including
the use of Machine Learning, are then the next step – a procedure that is nothing new in the world of official statistics. 
The presentation will nevertheless address these points and take a closer look at some of them. In particular, a procedure for
automated editing will be presented in more detail and the question of when a replacement of incorrect values can be described
as 'good' or 'successful' will be examined.

**Speaker:** [Alejandro Adem](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~adem/), University of British Columbia  
**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Title:** Topology and Symmetries  
**Abstract:** In this lecture we will discuss how methods from algebraic topology can be applied to shed light on fundamental
 questions related to finite group actions. We will start with basic invariants such as the Euler characteristic and explore
  classical applications such as topological space forms as well as more recent work about actions on 4-dimensional manifolds
   (joint with I. Hambleton). This will be illustrated with a variety of examples, as well as some open problems.

**Speaker:** [Giusy Mazzone](https://mast.queensu.ca/~gmazzone/index.html), Queen's University  
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Title:** [On the Mathematical Analysis of Fluid–Solid Interaction Problems](https://mast.queensu.ca/~gmazzone/publications.html)  
**Abstract:** I will present several models describing the interactions between
viscous incompressible fluids and solids, which may be either rigid or
deformable. The governing equations for these interactions consist of the
Navier–Stokes equations coupled with either the Euler equations for rigid body
dynamics or the Navier equations of linearized elasticity. A common feature of
these problems is that the governing equations have a dissipative—conservative
(parabolic—hyperbolic) structure: while the fluid introduces dissipation in the
mechanical energy of the coupled system, the solid contributes to the same
energy with a conservative (more generally, non-decreasing) component. From a
mathematical perspective, this interplay poses significant challenges when
establishing the existence and stability of solutions to the governing
equations. I will provide an overview of my contributions to the analysis of
these problems for various mechanical systems involving fluid–solid
interactions.

**Speaker:** [Jen Hom](https://jhom6.math.gatech.edu/), Georgia Institute of Technology  
**Title:** 3-Manifolds, Groups, and Heegaard Floer Homology  
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Location:** Exceptionally, this colloquium will take place in STEM 464.  
**Abstract:** We will consider various ways to build 3-manifolds. Under the operation of connected sum, 
the set of 3-manifolds forms a monoid, and modulo an appropriate equivalence relation, this monoid becomes
 a group. What is the structure of this group? What families of three-manifolds generate (or don’t generate) 
 this group? We give some answers to these questions using Heegaard Floer homology. This is joint work with
  (various subsets of) I. Dai, K. Hendricks, M. Stoffregen, L. Truong, and I. Zemke.

**Speaker:** [Sumiya Baasandorj](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QyoI7fQAAAAJ&hl=en), University of Ottawa  
**Title:** Regularity for a Class of (Non)Variational Problems with (Non)Standard Growth  
**Date:** September 25, 2025  
**Abstract:** Regularity issues in (non)variational problems with (non)standard growth have been
a central topic of analysis, witnessing tremendous development over the past century.
Regularity techniques ultimately aim to show that suitable weak or distributional solutions
are, in fact, classical solutions. In this talk, I will present some recent regularity
results for a class of variational functionals with nonstandard growth conditions,
namely the so-called Orlicz double phase functional. This will involve revisiting the
fundamental contributions of De Giorgi and Nash and connecting them with recent advances
in nonuniformly elliptic problems. Furthermore, I will try to give an overview of
the regularity theory for nonvariational elliptic problems, such as the Monge–Amp`ere
equation, and discuss its connections to optimal transport theory.

**Speaker:** [Emanuele Naldi](https://sites.google.com/view/emanuelenaldi/home-page), University of Genoa  
**Title:** [Inexact Jordan–Kinderlehrer–Otto and Proximal-Gradient Algorithms in the Wasserstein Space: Links and Differences from the Hilbert Case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23517)  
**Date:** September 18, 2025  
**Abstract:** In this talk, we explore the asymptotic convergence properties
of inexact Jordan–Kinderlehrer–Otto (JKO) scheme and proximal-gradient
algorithm in the Wasserstein space. While the classical JKO scheme
assumes exact minimization at each step, practical implementations rely
on approximate solutions due to computational constraints. We analyze
two types of inexactness: errors in Wasserstein distance and errors in
functional evaluations. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees
under controlled error conditions. Beyond the inexact setting, we also
extend the convergence results by considering varying stepsizes. Our
analysis expands previous approaches, providing new insights into
discrete Wasserstein gradient flows. We finish the talk with a comparison to the Hilbert space setting, where
the proximity operator is nonexpansive, a property that plays a central
role in many classical convergence results. In the Wasserstein setting,
the nonexpansivity of the proximity operator generally fails, even for
geodesically convex functionals. We discuss the class of functions for
which this property still holds and highlight potential directions for
future research.

**Speaker:** [Susanne Pumplün](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mathematics/people/susanne.pumpluen), University of Nottingham  
**Title:** [On Skew Constacyclic Codes and their Surprising Connection to Nonassociative Algebra](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.06695v1)  
**Date:** September 11, 2025  
**Abstract:** Cyclic, constacyclic and skew constacyclic codes are some of the most important and 
most investigated classes of linear codes (some are now also being used to build quantum 
error-correcting codes). Their cyclic structure allows us to characterize them using polynomials 
or skew polynomials, and to describe them as ideals in an algebra. More precisely, each codeword 
corresponds to a (skew) polynomial in a suitable chosen ideal of its ambient algebra. This ambient algebra may, 
however, be not associative. This is not well known, as all approaches 
so far only worked with associative ambient algebras or divert to ambient submodules. In the first part of the 
talk we will thus set up a cohesive theory that includes the nonassociative case. In the second part, we will address the problem how to classify skew constacyclic codes using the isomorphisms of their ambient algebras. We propose a new definition of equivalence that will result in tighter code classifications than previously presented ones, and will help to de-duplicate codes with the same performance paramenters. We prove with combinatorial methods that the notions of isometry and equivalence defined by Ou-azzou et al. (2025) coincide when the ambient algebras are not associative.

**Speaker:** [Francesca Bartolucci](https://sites.google.com/view/bartoluccifrancesca), Delft University of Technology    
**Title:** [Representation Equivalent Neural Operators: A Framework for Alias-Free Operator Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19913)  
**Date:** September 4, 2025  
**Abstract:** Recently, operator learning, or learning mappings between infinite-dimensional 
function spaces, has garnered significant attention, notably in relation to learning partial 
differential equations from data. Conceptually clear when outlined on paper, neural operators 
require discretization in the transition to computer implementations. This step can compromise 
their integrity, often causing them to deviate from the underlying operators. This research 
offers a fresh take on neural operators with a Representation equivalent Neural Operators (ReNO) 
framework designed to address these issues. At its core is the concept of operator aliasing, 
which measures inconsistency between neural operators and their discrete representations. More 
generally, this framework not only sheds light on existing challenges but, given its 
constructive and broad nature, also potentially offers tools for developing new neural 
operators. This is a joint work with Rima Alaifari, Emmanuel de Bézenac, Siddhartha Mishra, 
Roberto Molinaro and Bogdan Raonić.
