**Title:** Representation Equivalent Neural Operators: a Framework for Alias-free Operator Learning  
**Date:** September 4, 2025  
**Abstract:** Recently, operator learning, or learning mappings between infinite-dimensional 
function spaces, has garnered significant attention, notably in relation to learning partial 
differential equations from data. Conceptually clear when outlined on paper, neural operators 
require discretization in the transition to computer implementations. This step can compromise 
their integrity, often causing them to deviate from the underlying operators. This research 
offers a fresh take on neural operators with a Representation equivalent Neural Operators (ReNO) 
framework designed to address these issues. At its core is the concept of operator aliasing, 
which measures inconsistency between neural operators and their discrete representations. More 
generally, this framework not only sheds light on existing challenges but, given its 
constructive and broad nature, also potentially offers tools for developing new neural 
operators. This is a joint work with Rima Alaifari, Emmanuel de Bézenac, Siddhartha Mishra, 
Roberto Molinaro and Bogdan Raonić.

**Title:** On Skew Constacyclic Codes and their Surprising Connection to Nonassociative Algebra  
**Date:** September 11, 2025  
**Abstract:** Cyclic, constacyclic and skew constacyclic codes are some of the most important and 
most investigated classes of linear codes (some are now also being used to build quantum 
error-correcting codes). Their cyclic structure allows us to characterize them using  polynomials 
or skew polynomials, and to describe them as ideals in an algebra. More precisely, each codeword 
corresponds to a (skew) polynomial in a suitable chosen ideal of its ambient algebra. This ambient algebra may, however, be not associative. This is not well known, as all approaches 
so far only worked with associative ambient algebras or divert to ambient submodules. In the first part of the talk we will thus set up a cohesive theory that includes the nonassociative case.
In the second part, we will address the problem how to classify skew constacyclic codes using the isomorphisms of their ambient algebras. We propose a new definition of equivalence that will result in tighter code classifications than previously presented ones, and will help to de-duplicate codes with the same performance paramenters. We prove with combinatorial methods that the notions of isometry and equivalence defined by Ou-azzou et al. (2025) coincide when the ambient algebras are not associative.

**Title:** Inexact JKO and Proximal-gradient Algorithms in the Wasserstein Space: Links and Differences from the Hilbert Case  
**Date:** September 18, 2025  
**Abstract:** In this talk, we explore the asymptotic convergence properties
of inexact Jordan–Kinderlehrer–Otto (JKO) scheme and proximal-gradient
algorithm in the Wasserstein space. While the classical JKO scheme
assumes exact minimization at each step, practical implementations rely
on approximate solutions due to computational constraints. We analyze
two types of inexactness: errors in Wasserstein distance and errors in
functional evaluations. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees
under controlled error conditions. Beyond the inexact setting, we also
extend the convergence results by considering varying stepsizes. Our
analysis expands previous approaches, providing new insights into
discrete Wasserstein gradient flows.
We finish the talk with a comparison to the Hilbert space setting, where
the proximity operator is nonexpansive, a property that plays a central
role in many classical convergence results. In the Wasserstein setting,
the nonexpansivity of the proximity operator generally fails, even for
geodesically convex functionals. We discuss the class of functions for
which this property still holds and highlight potential directions for
future research.
